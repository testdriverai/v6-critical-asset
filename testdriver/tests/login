> -prompt: open Google Chrome

thinking...
    I can see the "Google Chrome" shortcut icon clearly on the
    desktop, which is the most direct way to open Google
    Chrome. I will click on the "Google Chrome" text under the
    icon to launch the browser.

      commands:
        - command: hover-text
          text: "Google Chrome"
          description: Google Chrome shortcut icon text on the desktop
          action: click

    This step will open Google Chrome as requested.

command='hover-text' text='Google Chrome' description='Google Chrome shortcut icon text on the desktop' action='click'
waiting for text: "Google Chrome"...
"Google Chrome" found!
thinking...
command='click' x=37 y=180 action='click'
checking...
    Confidence: 20%

    Reasoning: The screenshots show that the "Google Chrome"
    shortcut on the desktop has been clicked (it is
    highlighted and the cursor is on it), but there is no
    evidence that Google Chrome has actually opened yet. The
    active window is still undefined, and there is no Chrome
    window visible on the desktop.

    Next step: Wait a few seconds to allow Google Chrome to
    launch, then check again.

      commands:
        - command: wait
          timeout: 5000

not done yet!
command='wait' timeout=5000
checking...
    Confidence: 10%

    Reasoning: The screenshot shows the desktop with the
    "Google Chrome" shortcut highlighted and the mouse cursor
    over it, but there is no indication that Google Chrome has
    actually opened. The active window is still undefined, and
    there is no Chrome window visible. It appears that the
    shortcut has only been selected, not double-clicked or
    launched.

    Next step: Double-click the "Google Chrome" shortcut icon
    to ensure the browser opens.

      commands:
        - command: hover-text
          text: "Google Chrome"
          description: Google Chrome shortcut icon text on the desktop
          action: double-click

not done yet!
command='hover-text' text='Google Chrome' description='Google Chrome shortcut icon text on the desktop' action='double-click'
waiting for text: "Google Chrome"...
"Google Chrome" found!
thinking...
command='click' x=36 y=166 action='double-click'
checking...
    Confidence: 100%

    Reasoning: The second screenshot clearly shows that Google
    Chrome is open with a new tab displayed. The Chrome window
    is visible and active on the desktop, confirming that the
    task to open Google Chrome has been successfully
    completed. No further action is required.

success!
> -prompt: search Criticalasset.com

thinking...
    I can see that Google Chrome is open and the address bar
    at the top is empty and focused (blue outline). To search
    for "Criticalasset.com", I will type the query and press
    Enter.

      commands:
        - command: focus-application
          name: "Google Chrome"
        - command: type
          text: "Criticalasset.com"
        - command: press-keys
          keys:
            - "enter"

command='focus-application' name='Google Chrome'
command='type' text='Criticalasset.com'
command='press-keys' keys=enter
checking...
    Confidence: 100%

    Reasoning: The second screenshot clearly shows that the
    browser is on the "criticalasset.com" website, with the
    URL visible in the address bar and the CriticalAsset
    homepage loaded. This confirms that the search for
    "Criticalasset.com" was successful and the task is
    complete. No further actions are needed.

success!
> -prompt: Click on "Log In" button on top right side

thinking...
    I can see the "Log In" button clearly at the top right
    side of the CriticalAsset website in Google Chrome. The
    button text is "Log In" and it is distinct and visible.
    The next step is to click this button.

      commands:
        - command: focus-application
          name: "Google Chrome"
        - command: hover-text
          text: "Log In"
          description: Log In button on the top right of the CriticalAsset website header
          action: click

command='focus-application' name='Google Chrome'
command='hover-text' text='Log In' description='Log In button on the top right of the CriticalAsset website header' action='click'
waiting for text: "Log In"...
"Log In" found!
thinking...
command='click' x=836 y=161 action='click'
checking...
    Confidence: 100%

    Reasoning: The second screenshot shows that the browser
    has navigated to app.criticalasset.com/sign-in/ in a new
    tab, which is the expected result after clicking the "Log
    In" button on the top right of the CriticalAsset homepage.
    This confirms that the "Log In" button was successfully
    clicked and the intended action was completed. No further
    steps are needed.

success!
> -prompt: In Email box type "gopal@criticalasset.com"

thinking...
    I can see the login screen for CriticalAsset, with the
    "Email" input box clearly visible and empty. The best way
    to focus the email input is to click on the "Email"
    placeholder text, then type the provided email address.

      commands:
        - command: focus-application
          name: "Google Chrome"
        - command: hover-text
          text: "Email"
          description: Email input placeholder above the password field on the login form
          action: click
        - command: type
          text: "gopal@criticalasset.com"

command='focus-application' name='Google Chrome'
command='hover-text' text='Email' description='Email input placeholder above the password field on the login form' action='click'
waiting for text: "Email"...
"Email" found!
thinking...
command='click' x=588 y=316 action='click'
command='type' text='gopal@criticalasset.com'
checking...
    Confidence: 0%

    Reasoning: The screenshots show that the "Email" input box
    is empty and the cursor is hovering over the "Email"
    placeholder, but the email address "
    gopal@criticalasset.com (mailto:gopal@criticalasset.com)"
    has not been typed into the box yet. The task is not
    complete.

    Here is the next step to type the email address into the
    Email box:

      commands:
        - command: type
          text: "gopal@criticalasset.com"

not done yet!
command='type' text='gopal@criticalasset.com'
checking...
    Confidence: 0%

    Reasoning: The attached screenshots show that the "Email"
    input box is still empty and the cursor is hovering over
    the "Email" placeholder. The email address "
    gopal@criticalasset.com (mailto:gopal@criticalasset.com)"
    has not been typed into the input box yet. The task is not
    complete.

    Here is the next step to type the email address into the
    Email box:

      commands:
        - command: type
          text: "gopal@criticalasset.com"

not done yet!
command='type' text='gopal@criticalasset.com'
checking...
    Confidence: 0%

    Reasoning: The screenshot clearly shows that the "Email"
    input box is still empty, and the cursor is hovering over
    the "Email" placeholder. The email address "
    gopal@criticalasset.com (mailto:gopal@criticalasset.com)"
    has not been entered into the box. Previous attempts to
    type have failed, so the input may not be focused
    correctly.

    Next, I will try to ensure the input is focused by
    clicking the "Email" placeholder again, then immediately
    type the email address.

      commands:
        - command: focus-application
          name: "Google Chrome"
        - command: hover-text
          text: "Email"

command='click' x=593 y=335 action='click'
command='type' text='gopal@criticalasset.com'

    Confidence: 100%

    The task is complete. In the most recent screenshot, the
    "Email" input box contains the text "
    gopal@criticalasset.com (mailto:gopal@criticalasset.com)"
    as required. No further action is needed.

success!
> -prompt: In password box type "mh29AR@#0915"

thinking...
    I can see the CriticalAsset login screen in Google Chrome.
    The "Email" field is filled, and the "Password" field is
    directly below it, with the placeholder "Password"
    visible. The best way to focus the password input is to
    click on the "Password" placeholder text, then type the
    password.

      commands:
        - command: focus-application
          name: "Google Chrome"
        - command: hover-text
          text: "Password"
          description: Password input placeholder below the email field on the login form
          action: click
        - command: type

command='focus-application' name='Google Chrome'
command='hover-text' text='Password' description='Password input placeholder below the email field on the login form' action='click'

"Password" found!
thinking...
command='click' x=610 y=402 action='click'
command='type' text='mh29AR@#0915'
checking...
    Confidence: 100%

    The task is complete. In the most recent screenshot, the
    password box contains a masked password (dots), and the
    mouse cursor is positioned over the password field. This
    indicates that the password "mh29AR@#0915" has been
    entered into the password box as requested. No further
    action is needed.

success!
> -prompt: Click on "SIGN IN" button in yellow color

thinking...
    I can see the "SIGN IN" button in yellow color clearly
    below the password field on the CriticalAsset login page
    in Google Chrome. The best way to interact with it is to
    click the "SIGN IN" text.

      commands:
        - command: focus-application
          name: "Google Chrome"
        - command: hover-text
          text: "SIGN IN"
          description: Yellow SIGN IN button below the password field on the login form

command='focus-application' name='Google Chrome'
command='hover-text' text='SIGN IN' description='Yellow SIGN IN button below the password field on the login form' action='click'
waiting for text: "SIGN IN"...
"SIGN IN" found!
thinking...
command='click' x=793 y=489 action='click'
checking...
    Confidence: 100%

    The task is complete. In the second screenshot, the
    CriticalAsset dashboard is visible, which means the "SIGN
    IN" button was successfully clicked and the login was
    successful. No further action is needed.

success!
